We now have (key, author) pairs.
The next step is to put them in a relational database
so that we can start asking and answering questions.
Our starting point is the final script from the previous topic:


```{r}
#for (i in 1:nrow(bibData)) {
for (i in 1:5) {
    key<-bibData[i,1]
    authors<-strsplit(as.character(bibData[i,4]),"; ")[[1]]
    for (j in 1:length(authors)) {
        print(paste(key,authors[j]))
    }
}
```




whose output looks like this:

~~~ {.output}
[1] "8SW85SQM McClelland, James L"
[1] "85QV9X5F McClelland, J. L."
[1] "85QV9X5F McNaughton, B. L."
[1] "85QV9X5F O'Reilly, R. C."
[1] "Z4X6DT6N Ratcliff, R."
[1] "F5DGU3Q4 McCloskey, M."
[1] "F5DGU3Q4 Cohen, N. J."
[1] "PNGQMCP5 Buciluǎ, Cristian"
[1] "PNGQMCP5 Caruana, Rich"
[1] "PNGQMCP5 Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru"
~~~

What we *want* is a series of SQL `insert` statements:

~~~ {.output}
insert into data values('8SW85SQM', 'McClelland, James L');
insert into data values('85QV9X5F', 'McClelland, J. L.');
insert into data values('85QV9X5F', 'McNaughton, B. L.');
~~~

so let's modify the program to print this instead:



```{r}
INSERT <- "insert into data values('%s','%s');"
for (i in 1:5) {
   key<-bibData[i,1]
   authors<-strsplit(as.character(bibData[i,4]),"; ")[[1]]
   for (j in 1:length(authors)) {
       print(sprintf(INSERT,key,authors[j]))
   }
}
```
~~~ {.output}
[1] "insert into data values('8SW85SQM','McClelland, James L');"
[1] "insert into data values('85QV9X5F','McClelland, J. L.');"
[1] "insert into data values('85QV9X5F','McNaughton, B. L.');"
[1] "insert into data values('85QV9X5F','O'Reilly, R. C.');"
[1] "insert into data values('Z4X6DT6N','Ratcliff, R.');"
[1] "insert into data values('F5DGU3Q4','McCloskey, M.');"
[1] "insert into data values('F5DGU3Q4','Cohen, N. J.');"
[1] "insert into data values('PNGQMCP5','Buciluǎ, Cristian');"
[1] "insert into data values('PNGQMCP5','Caruana, Rich');"
[1] "insert into data values('PNGQMCP5','Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru');"
~~~

The first change is the definition of `INSERT`,
which is the format string for our insertion statements.
The second change is that instead of printing the key and author directly,
we interpolate those values into `INSERT` using `sprintf`.

This works,
but only if by "works" we mean
"runs to completion without an obvious error".
Upon closer inspection,
there are two problems:

1.  Nobody is actually creating a database table
    for us to insert things into.

2.  Authors names can contain single quotes.

3. Each output starts with [1] and the text is surrounded by double quotes \" \".

The first is easy to solve ---
we just add this at the start of our program:


```{r}
CREATE = 'create table data(key text not null, author text not null);'
```

and print it out before printing any of the `insert` statements.

The second problem is trickier:

if we interpolate a name like "O'Mear, Fiona" into `INSERT`,
the result will be:

```{r}
"insert into data values('RJS8QDC4', 'O'Mear, Fiona');"
```

which isn't legal R.
The fix there is simply to use double quotes around our strings instead of single quotes,
since people's names can't contain the former.

Once we make this change, our whole program is:


```{r}
INSERT <- "insert into data values(\"%s\",\"%s\");"
for (i in 1:5) {
   key<-bibData[i,1]
   authors<-strsplit(as.character(bibData[i,4]),"; ")[[1]]
   for (j in 1:length(authors)) {
       cat(sprintf(INSERT,key,authors[j]),sep="\n")
   }
}
```
To use the double quotes inside `INSERT`, We used \\\". 

The heading [1] was removed by the use of `cat` instead of `print`.
The argument `sep="\n"` ensures each line is separated.

Let's run it:

~~~ {.output}
insert into data values("8SW85SQM","McClelland, James L");
insert into data values("85QV9X5F","McClelland, J. L.");
insert into data values("85QV9X5F","McNaughton, B. L.");
insert into data values("85QV9X5F","O'Reilly, R. C.");
insert into data values("Z4X6DT6N","Ratcliff, R.");
insert into data values("F5DGU3Q4","McCloskey, M.");
insert into data values("F5DGU3Q4","Cohen, N. J.");
insert into data values("PNGQMCP5","Buciluǎ, Cristian");
insert into data values("PNGQMCP5","Caruana, Rich");
insert into data values("PNGQMCP5","Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru");
~~~

That looks pretty good.


Let's put everything together and save the following code as "convert-db.R". Note that the for loop now runs with all entries in bibData by `nrow(bibData)`.

```{r}
filename <- "/home/seb56/swc/swc_vuw2015/db/data/bibliography.csv"
bibData <- read.csv(file=filename, header=FALSE,sep=",")

CREATE = 'create table data(key text not null, author text not null);'
cat(CREATE,sep="\n")

INSERT <- "insert into data values(\"%s\",\"%s\");"
for (i in 1:nrow(bibData)) {
   key<-bibData[i,1]
   authors<-strsplit(as.character(bibData[i,4]),"; ")[[1]]
   for (j in 1:length(authors)) {
       cat(sprintf(INSERT,key,authors[j]),sep="\n")
   }
}
```
and execute the following command.

~~~ {.input}
$ Rscript code/convert-db.R
~~~
This will output a SQL command that produces the `data` table followed by thosands of SQL insert commands. (Total of 6610 lines)

```{sql}
create table data(key text not null, author text not null);
insert into data values("8SW85SQM","McClelland, James L");
insert into data values("85QV9X5F","McClelland, J. L.");
insert into data values("85QV9X5F","McNaughton, B. L.");
insert into data values("85QV9X5F","O'Reilly, R. C.");
insert into data values("Z4X6DT6N","Ratcliff, R.");
insert into data values("F5DGU3Q4","McCloskey, M.");
insert into data values("F5DGU3Q4","Cohen, N. J.");
insert into data values("PNGQMCP5","Buciluǎ, Cristian");
...
insert into data values("UKMMCR7E","Osowski, Stanislaw");
insert into data values("UKMMCR7E","Hoai, Linh Tran");
insert into data values("UKMMCR7E","Markiewicz, Tomasz");

```
To create a database, let's use a pipe.
~~~ {.input}
$ Rscript code/convert-db.R | sqlite3 bibligraphy.db
~~~
 
This pipeline takes about four seconds to run on my laptop,
and creates a 205 kbyte file called `bibliography.db`.
Let's have a look at what that database contains:

~~~ {.input}
$ Rscript code/convert-db.R |sqlite3 bibliography.db
~~~
~~~ {.input}
$ sqlite3 bibliography.db
SQLite version 3.8.5 2014-08-15 22:37:57
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE data(key text not null, author text not null);

sqlite> select * from data limit 10;
8SW85SQM|McClelland, James L
85QV9X5F|McClelland, J. L.
85QV9X5F|McNaughton, B. L.
85QV9X5F|O'Reilly, R. C.
Z4X6DT6N|Ratcliff, R.
F5DGU3Q4|McCloskey, M.
F5DGU3Q4|Cohen, N. J.
PNGQMCP5|Buciluǎ, Cristian
PNGQMCP5|Caruana, Rich
PNGQMCP5|Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru
~~~

That looks good,
so let's try asking some questions:

~~~ {.sql}
select author, count(*) from data group by author order by count(*) desc limit 10;
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Bengio, Yoshua|122
Bengio, Y.|111
Hinton, Geoffrey E.|78
LeCun, Yann|56
Hinton, G. E.|45
Salakhutdinov, Ruslan|34
LeCun, Y.|31
Vincent, Pascal|29
Jordan, M. I.|27
Frasconi, P.|25
~~~

The first thing we see is that our work has paid off:
we can now find out who the most prolific authors are with a single command.
The second thing we see is that we're not done yet:
"Bengio, Yoshua" and "Bengio, Y." are almost certainly the same person,
as are "LeCun, Yann" and "LeCun, Y.".
If we really want to know who has written the most papers,
we're going to have to reconcile different names for the same person.

Instead of normalizing names,
let's see what other questions we can answer.
Who has co-authored papers with whom?

~~~ {.sql}
select a.author, b.author from data a join data b on a.key=b.key and a.author > b.author limit 10;
~~~
~~~ {.output}
McNaughton, B. L.|McClelland, J. L.
O'Reilly, R. C.|McClelland, J. L.
O'Reilly, R. C.|McNaughton, B. L.
McCloskey, M.|Cohen, N. J.
Caruana, Rich|Buciluǎ, Cristian
Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru|Buciluǎ, Cristian
Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru|Caruana, Rich
Rigamonti, Roberto|Fua, Pascal
Rigamonti, Roberto|Lepetit, Vincent
Sironi, Amos|Fua, Pascal
~~~

(We use `a.author > b.author` to ensure that
each distinct pair of authors only shows up once.)
What if we want to know how often different pairs of people have written together?

~~~ {.sql}
select a.author, b.author, count(*)
from data a join data b
on a.key=b.key and a.author > b.author
group by a.author, b.author
order by count(*) desc
limit 10;
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Vincent, Pascal|Bengio, Yoshua|27
Roux, Nicolas Le|Bengio, Yoshua|20
Delalleau, Olivier|Bengio, Yoshua|19
Bengio, Y.|Bengio, S.|18
Larochelle, Hugo|Bengio, Yoshua|15
Roux, Nicolas Le|Delalleau, Olivier|15
Vincent, P.|Bengio, Y.|15
Chapados, N.|Bengio, Y.|14
Gori, M.|Frasconi, P.|14
Salakhutdinov, Ruslan|Hinton, Geoffrey E.|14
~~~

Again,
we have a data normalization problem:
the pair "Vincent, Pascal" and "Bengio, Yoshua"
is almost certainly the same as the pair "Bengio, Y." and "Bengio, S.".
But that problem would be there
even if we were analyzing this data manually,
and putting it in a database has made asking new questions so easy
that we can do research we otherwise wouldn't have been able to tackle.
The final step is to commit our script to Git
and celebrate with a nice cup of tea.
