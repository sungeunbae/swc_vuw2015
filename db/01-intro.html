<p>We’d like to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How many papers has each person contributed to?</p></li>
<li><p>Who collaborates with whom?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we only cared about one author, we could search for her name in the spreadsheet to answer the first question, then select those rows and manually tally her co-authors to answer the second. But doing that for all of the authors one by one would take days, we’d almost certainly make mistakes, and then someone would almost certainly hand us another, larger spreadsheet and we’d have to start over.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re going to do instead:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Write a little Python program to print (key, author) pairs for every contributor to every paper. For example, this program will turn the first three rows of the spreadsheet into:</p>
<pre><code>8SW85SQM McClelland, James L
85QV9X5F McClelland, J. L.
85QV9X5F McNaughton, B. L.
85QV9X5F O&#39;Reilly, R. C.
Z4X6DT6N Ratcliff, R.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Modify this program to create SQL <code>insert</code> statements to put keys and authors into a database.</p></li>
<li><p>Use SQL queries to answer our original questions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This might seem like a lot of work to answer two questions, but for anything more than a half-dozen rows, it will save us a lot of time:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once the data is in a database, it will be easy to ask and answer many other questions.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll be able to re-use our tools on the next spreadsheet we’re given.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll have a record of what we did (something that clicking in a spreadsheet won’t give us).</p></li>
<li><p>It’s more likely to be correct.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The spreadsheet contains 2937 rows. How accurate does manual transcription have to be for us to have a 99% chance of getting the whole analysis right? I.e., what error-per-row rate gives us a 0.99 probability completing the entire task correctly?</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="challenge panel panel-success">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span>Breaking Even</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>If it takes 10 minutes to write a program to do a task that only takes 5 minutes to do by hand, the program is only worth writing if the task has to be done more than twice. Similarly, if we only wanted to find out who had co-authored papers with one specific author, and we were sure we would never have any other questions or need to re-do the analysis, manually searching the spreadsheet would probably be faster than transcribing the data into a database.</p>
<p>Choose some task that you currently do by hand. Estimate how long it takes you to do it each time, how often you do it, and how long it would take you to write a program to do the task instead. How much time would programming actually save you? How sure are you?</p>
