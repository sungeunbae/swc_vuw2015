title: Databases and SQL
---
The sample data used in the world database is Copyright Statistics Finland, http://www.stat.fi/worldinfigures. 

Three common options for storage are
text files,
spreadsheets,
and databases.
Text files are easiest to create,
and work well with version control,
but then we would have to build search and analysis tools ourselves.
Spreadsheets are good for doing simple analyses,
but they don't handle large or complex data sets well.
Databases, however, include powerful tools for search and analysis,
and can handle large, complex data sets.
These lessons will show how to use a database to explore the statistical data.

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> If SQLite is being used from the shell,
> learners will need to be able to navigate directories
> and run simple commands from the command line.
> If a GUI such as the Firefox SQLite plugin is being used,
> learners will need to know how to install browser plugins
> (and have permission to do so).
